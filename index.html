        <div>
            Amykels Baking and Culinary Academy was founded in 2016 with 6 students composed of 5 girls and a boy with Mrs Amarachukwu Okafor as the teacher,  principal and proprietor. <br><br>
        The school started with short course, students get enrolled and are trained for 1-3 months and they are done.<br><br>
        In the year 2018, more people started gaining interest to acquire baking skills, then Mrs Amarachukwu Okafor introduced more courses and extended the training period to 6 months/ 1 year.
        This made the school to gain more students. 
        </div>
        <div>
            From the year 2018 – 2022 the school have produced over 150 professional chefs in pastries & cookeries.<br><br>
        In the year 2023, we started having our vendors support and encouragement on our students during their graduation with lots of gift items just to encourage them. <br>
        Our graduates are scattered all over the nation and they are doing great.<br><br>
        This year 2024, we thought it would be of good to be recognized by the government of Nigeria so our certificate would be Authentic and recognized. <br>

        <P>My experience with Amykels has been amazing, 
        there were so many things i thought i knew but i really didn't. <br>
        I like how we're not just learning about food, 
        we're learning about the science behind food, bakery and decoration.</P>

        <P>I took the bold step to get baking and culinary studies at Amykels Academy, Anambra. <br>
        This opened my eyes, mind and world to this side of life and officially welcomed me to this beautiful part of the world. <br>
        My total respect goes to Okafor Amarachukwu whose passion for the culinary world influenced me so much <br>
        and is a daily reminder of where I need to be and what I need to do.</P>

        <P>Kicking off my passion for baking in 2021 with the experience with Amykels instructors was not an easy journey.<br>
            Being away from home over a year now has shown me it was indeed worthwhile. But in the end, it does worth it</P>
